# Java-Maze-with-DFS
This was a project for professor Black, the goal was to edit the maze so that it is controlled by a method named DoMazeguidedWalk() and use DFS to traverse through the maze and eventually find a solution, use that solution (ArrayList&lt;Integer>) to actually solve the puzzle. Fall Semester 2020
